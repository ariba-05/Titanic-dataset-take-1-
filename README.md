# Titanic-dataset-take-1-
KaggleScore of 79.909. My first try at the very famous and the very basic titanic dataset using the little python I have learnt. The codes are insanely long right now(making me realize that I must learnt o use pandas now :P), but I plan to revisit  them some day. 


I have used all features. And besides, done some feature engineering to separate "Ticket prefix" and "Ticket nos.". I have then predicted missing valus of "Ages" of the all passengers in the training set as well as the test set using DecisionTreeRegressor. Any suggestions are welcome.
